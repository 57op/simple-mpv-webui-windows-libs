# simple-mpv-webui windows libraries
Building script to compile [luajit](https://luajit.org/) and [luasocket](https://github.com/diegonehab/luasocket) needed for [simple-mpv-webui](https://github.com/open-dynaMIX/simple-mpv-webui) addon.

## Requirements
- Download and install `git`: https://git-scm.com/download/win (mostly needed for its `bash` environment)  
- Download and install [MinGW-W64 GCC 8.1.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/) `x86_64` or `i686` (to match `mpv` version you're going to use. I use `x86_64-posix-seh branch` since I use 64bit mpv releases by [shinchiro](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpv-player-windows/files/))  
- Add `MinGW-W64` bin directory to `PATH` environment variable
- Clone this repo `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/chuck-/simple-mpv-webui-windows-libs`  

## Compiling
Open git bash, cd to this repository and launch `build.sh` to automatically start the building process:  
```
$ source build.sh
```

## Installing
Copy all the contents from `mpv` directory (generated by the script in the repository directory) to your mpv installation directory.  

## Downloads
